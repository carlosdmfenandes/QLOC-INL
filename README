PURPOSE
This repository contains files used by me and my coleagues for my doctoral project 
on quantum linear optical computation at INL. 
Our objective is to study linear quantum optical computers and their limitations. 
Most of these files concern with the calculation of the permanent of a unitary matrix. 
The permanent is considered a difficult calculations. The best general algorithms
scale as N2^N.
The permanent is necessary to simulated QLO systems.
Often our matrix has repeated lines and columns. Under that assumption,
the efficiency of the calculation can be improved.
